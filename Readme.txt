This application uses the open-source dasboard template from keen IO - https://keen.github.io/dashboards/

	The objective of the application is to automate the QA process comprising of multiple manual tasks. The UI is built on HTML5 including php and javascript. The backend tasks run through multiple python tasks executing the QI tasks which are connected to the UI using php calls. 
This is chartered for a specific process flow, and so requires code changes for reuse.
